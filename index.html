# Case Study: NYC Parking Tickets

The Problem: Parking enforcement can be an important source of revenue for city budgets, but
when one fire hydrant generates an annual $25,000 in parking tickets, it can be a signal that something's wrong.

# Case Study: Data Analysis

![img-center-90](images/forsyth_before.png)

???

The Analysis: First, Ben Wellington looked at NYPD's Parking Ticket data, available on New York City's Open Data Portal. He quickly identified outliers. Outliers are numbers in the data that don't make sense; they might be very high or very low. In this case he found that two spots in front of fire hydrants generated a combined total of $55,000 in parking tickets for one year.

Next, Wellington found the location of each of the fire hydrants from a field in the open data set, and matched it to an image in Google Street View. He saw that both these spots were set a few feet away from the curb. In fact, the car in this Google Street image had a parking ticket! Maybe drivers mistakenly thought it was legal to park there?

# Case Study: Solution

![img-center-60](images/forsyth_after.png).caption[Screenshot from [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7181889,-73.9929608,3a,37.5y,246.59h,71.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssfMgEIL99frCBXgzXLm7PQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)]

???

The Solution:
Ben published his findings to his website and New Yorkers took note. Soon after, the Department of Transportation painted stripes over those spots, so drivers could easily identify them as no-parking zones. Would the DOT have known these spots needed clear signage if NYPD hadn't opened their parking ticket data?

# Case Study: Recap

+ Problem: Two spots are generating $55,000 in parking tickets each year. What's going on here?
+ Analysis: Found outliers in NYPD open data set. Cross-matched to open data from Google Street View.
+ Solution: DOT painted new stripes in these spots to discourage parking.

Open data created an opportunity for civic engagement, and for one city agency to benefit from the insights generated by another agency's data.

# Check for Understanding

Last winter was unusually cold in Topeka, KS, and residents flooded City Hall with complaints about the lack of snow plows, salt and shovelers, as they dug out from multiple blizzards. The Department of Sanitation is allocating funds for the coming snow season. They've decided to bring in a data analyst to help them prepare their budget. What type of analysis should they conduct?

+ a) operational
+ b) quantifying needs
+ c) performance metrics
+ d) prioritization


???

Students will have been introduced to four types of data analysis typically conducted by government agencies. Some students may pick a) operational analysis, which is typically done to better understand and improve workflows or d) prioritization, which is can be used to guide decision-making under constraints. However, the correct answer is b) quantifying needs, which helps managers understand how many people, or how much time, money or equipment to allocate to a particular project or program.

# Six Stages of Data Analysis

![img-center-90](images/sixphases_1.jpg)

???

Data analysis is more than just crunching numbers! It requires a real team effort to scope the problem and make sure you're collecting the right data to answer your question. Next, your data analyst(s) will need to spend time cleaning or "munging" the data so that it's in the right state to answer your question. Only then can you test your hypotheses or find the answers to your questions. But you're not done yet!

Some studies have shown that 88% of spreadsheets have errors, so it's critical that you check your findings with a colleague or two and plan to re-run your analysis if you get unexpected results.

There's no one right order to these stages. Some people use data visualizations to help them explore datasets and come up with questions; other times, you might discover an error when you verify your results and need to go back to collect different data or retest your hypothesis. When you have a complicated question or are working with lots of data, you might need to find your own unique path through a data analysis. What's important to remember is that good data analysis takes time and a diverse team who can bring multiple perspectives to the table.

# Exercise: Interpreting Data Visualization

![img-center-90](images/311data.png)

???

Take a look at this graph. What story is it telling?

Write down three things you know about 311 noise complaints from seeing this graphic.
Write down three questions you have about 311 noise complaints after seeing this graphic.

Data can describe a phenomenon directly or indirectly. Is this a direct measure of noise in NYC? Why or why not?
